# Real-Time Plant Weight Monitoring

This botanical project calculates and records the weight change of a plant per second based on the average data from load cell sensors. By continuously monitoring and averaging the readings from multiple load cells, the system ensures accurate real-time tracking of the plant's weight variations.
